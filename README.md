# Langton-Ant-Multithreaded
Java Implementation of Langton's Ant with multithreading

First try at adding multithreading to a program and I am pretty happy with the results!
Ants at strange when running fullspeed but I believe when "Thread.Sleep(1)" is called the ants act normally to their respective rules
Program allows for lots and lots of ants to move on the screen at once! It is quite fun to watch as the do sometimes fight each other for territory! There are still some things that i'd like to fix but as of now I am quite pleased with the progress of this small project! - David
